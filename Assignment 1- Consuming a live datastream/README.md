<h1 style="text-align:center"> Consuming a Live DataStream</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The main aim of this assignment is to connect resources on the Internet to resources in the world. One of the ways this can be done, is 
by consuming live data available on the Internet, using a web API.</p>

<h2>Public Datastream</h2>
<p>For getting the data, I used the PubNub API. It is a public Data Stream Network that connects directly to various channels, such as twitter channel,
wikipedia channel, traffic feed etc. And is able to read in live data, the second they come in. </p>

<p>PubNub provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Realtime Analytics.</li>
    <li>Online Presence detection.</li>
    <li>Public Scribe Messaging <b>etc.</b></li>
</ul>
 <p>More details can be found on their <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/" target="_blank">Website</a></p>
 
 <p>For this assignment, I visualized twitter data from PubNub (with the help of several libraries), into both a
